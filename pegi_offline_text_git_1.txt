At that moment, the phone rings, the woman picks up and we hear him say: "Yes my darling ... no ... ah ... ok ... of course, see you later."

A young man, all that is most correct, wanted to buy a Christmas present for his new girlfriend. After careful consideration, he decided to buy her a pair of gloves, and accompanied by her new friend's sister for better advice, he went to buy them. The sister, for her part, bought two pairs of panties for herself. During the packaging, the seller mixed the two items and the sister got the gloves ... Without checking the package, he sent the panties to his lover with the following note: Sweet darling, Here is a small gift to prove to you that I don haven't forgotten christmas. My choice is due to the fact that I realized that you used not to wear it when you went out at night. If it had not been for your younger sister, I would have chosen a longer pair with buttons, but she herself wears shorter pairs, easy to remove.The color is rather pale, but the seller showed me a pair she had worn for three weeks and it was barely dirty. The young saleswoman did the test in front of me and it made her very good. I wish I could have put them to you myself the first time. No doubt many other men will hug them before I can see you again. When you take them out, breathe in before putting them away to wipe away the moisture that remains after use. I hope you will like them and that you will wear them for me on New Years Day. Just think of the number of times I'll have the pleasure of kissing them. Finally, the latest fashion is to wear them with the folded edges showing the fur. I love you
