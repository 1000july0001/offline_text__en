An unemployed worker applies for a job as a housekeeper at Microsoft. The HR manager gave him an interview, then a test (sweep the floor), and said to him: - You are hired; give me your email and I'll send you the form to fill out, along with the date and time you need to show up to start your job. The desperate man replies that he does not have a computer, let alone an email. The HRD then tells him that he is sorry, but that if he does not have an e-mail, it means that virtually he does not exist, and, as he does not exist, he cannot have the job. The man goes out, without knowing what to do. He only has 10 dollars in his pocket. So he decides to go to the supermarket and buy a case of 5 kilos of tomatoes. He therefore went door to door to sell his tomatoes by the kilo, and in less than two hours, managed to double his capital. He repeats the operation three more times and returns home with $ 60. So he realizes that he can survive this way, he leaves home every day earlier and returns home later, and triple or quadruple his money every day. Shortly after, he buys a cart, then the exchange for a truck and soon after finds himself with a small fleet of delivery vehicles. Spent 5 years, the man owned one of the largest food distributors in the United States. He then thought of the future of his family, and decides to take out life insurance. He calls an insurer, chooses an insurance plan and when the conversation ends, the insurer asks him for his e-mail to send him the proposal. The man then says that he has no e-mail .- Curious, says the insurer, you don't have an email and you have managed to build this empire, imagine what you would be if you had an email !!! The man thinks and answers : - I would be a cleaning man at Microsoft.
A couple of illegitimate lovers dine by candlelight in the lady's apartment. The man asks: - Isn't your husband likely to return? it bothers me you know, especially since he's my best friend anyway ... - Oh, don't worry, we still have it for a good hour. At that moment, the phone rings, the woman picks up and we hear him say: "Yes my darling ... no ... ah ... ok ... of course, see you later." She comes back to the table and her lover asks: - Was it him? - Yes. Don't worry, we still have it for a good hour, he's playing a game of pool with youâ€¦.
A young man, all that is most correct, wanted to buy a Christmas present for his new girlfriend. After careful consideration, he decided to buy her a pair of gloves, and accompanied by her new friend's sister for better advice, he went to buy them. The sister, for her part, bought two pairs of panties for herself. During the packaging, the seller mixed the two items and the sister got the gloves ... Without checking the package, he sent the panties to his lover with the following note: Sweet darling, Here is a small gift to prove to you that I don haven't forgotten christmas. My choice is due to the fact that I realized that you used not to wear it when you went out at night. If it had not been for your younger sister, I would have chosen a longer pair with buttons, but she herself wears shorter pairs, easy to remove.The color is rather pale, but the seller showed me a pair she had worn for three weeks and it was barely dirty. The young saleswoman did the test in front of me and it made her very good. I wish I could have put them to you myself the first time. No doubt many other men will hug them before I can see you again. When you take them out, breathe in before putting them away to wipe away the moisture that remains after use. I hope you will like them and that you will wear them for me on New Years Day. Just think of the number of times I'll have the pleasure of kissing them. Finally, the latest fashion is to wear them with the folded edges showing the fur. I love you
